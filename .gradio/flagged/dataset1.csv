As for remedies, I would suggest maintaining good skincare habits such as washing your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser, using a topical cream or gel containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to help control acne, and avoiding picking or popping the pimples to prevent infection and scarring.",,2025-06-14 14:11:44.220478
